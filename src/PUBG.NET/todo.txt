* comments.
* convert the world to async. <-- important
* Split client helper into different files based on endpoints.
* make lists of ids instead call upon a getter to make a request to grab that infos.
* add support for roster type in Match.
* remove comments and move to xml descriptions.
* make team variable useful, need data from a squads game.
* throw exception when servers are down.
* okay so enums are FUCKED and some utility needs to be built to convert string to shard enum since attributes dont do fucking shit.
* add support for telemetry parser to take text rather than reading from file.
* verify all json->classes inside telemetry service correctly deserialized.
* add username as a search type for PUBGClient.GetPlayer as it only currently works with ids.
* explain things better in getting started, like how to get your last couple of matches.
